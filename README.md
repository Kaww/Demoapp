## üëÄ What's about?

It's n app built in SwiftUI that will help UI/UX designers and iOS developpers to work together smoothly. It will also help people learning about iOS capabilities, limitations, ecosystem, etc by allowing them to maninulate these features.

- List several iOS capabilities.
- Allows people to discover and manipulate these features. (e.g. spring animations, with sliders to manipulate parameters)
- Allows people to export or share some data or parameters (mostly based on swiftui APIs). (e.g. copy or share code samples to share with developers)
